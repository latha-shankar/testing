    		   <p>
    		   	The Arabic style of applying mehndi is free flowing in nature and majority of designs comprise patterns of leaves, vines, birds and flowers. While Indian mehndi or henna is applied covering the entire hand, Arabic mehndi is less intricate. It usually focuses on the palm unlike Indian mehndi which flows through the wrists.

    			<p>
    			Mehndi is a ceremonial art form common in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and occasionally Afghanistan. It is typically applied during weddings - for Sikh, Muslim and Hindu brides. In Rajasthan, the grooms are given designs that are often as elaborate as those for brides. In Assam, apart from marriage, it is broadly used by unmarried women during Rongali bihu.

    <h1 class="title">History of Mehndi</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="para">The art of applying henna in hands and feet is known as Mehndi and it is a very old custom and ancient art form of the Asian subcontinent. The propagators were the Mughals. The Mughals taught us all about the history of Mehndi and introduced it to India during 12th century AD. During that period the royal and rich use to decorate themselves with it. The patterns were intricately made by the artists or the beauticians.

    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="para">The use of mehndi has its origins in the ancient Middle East and Indian Subcontinent where it was used in civilizations such as Babylon and Ancient Egypt. It was prevalent in fourth century in India, which is evident from cave art in the Deccan, specifically in the Ajanta Caves.</p>
